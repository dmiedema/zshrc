# zshrc
my zshrc configuration. Full of magic and wonder.

## Requirements

[antigen](https://github.com/zsh-users/antigen) is used for plugin management along with other general awesomeness.

This expects the repo to be cloned to `~/.antigen/` so running


`git clone https://github.com/zsh-users/antigen ~/.antigen/` should be enough
